# Custom-made GPU

A standard 640x480 VGA-generating GPU for my computer build, as listed in the parent directory. Having only one bit per pixel for color, this makes it extremely useful for rendering a text display.

## Why did I build this?
I think that every computer should have a graphical output of some form, and this is as simple as it gets. This expansion board will allow me to do a lot of cool things with my project.

## Explaining the inner workings

The card uses a 640x480 60hz resolution, running over a standard VGA cable. This can be converted with a dongle to HDMI or DisplayPort. The card has four registers: pixel location X, pixel location Y, data write register and control register.
Since the card uses one bit per pixel, there can be eight pixels stored in a single byte of VRAM at once. Therefore, you can write eight pixels are once, going left to right. A standard text display has each character being 8x16 pixels in size, so you can perfectly write in each character using 16 different write cycles. The text resolution is 80x30 characters, fitting inside a 640x480 text display. This is certanly not limited to text, just optimized for it. You can use a dithering algorithm to draw in more advanced graphics and images.
The pixel X register actually moves the pixel selector 8 pixels at a time, and you can selectively write bits for each one. It also supports basic double buffering, since it uses a single 128k x 8 SRAM module. 640x480 uses less than half of the space, so the highest-most but is used to select the frame. The user can write to a back frame before switching them. It is then automatically switched at the end of each frame. Pixels are preloaded every eight cycles, and is kept track of using the X counter, which keeps track of which pixel is being displayed at any time. During the first low phase of the clock, the addresses are changed from the user-defined addresses to the ones found in the counters, and the RAM is outputted to store eight pixels are a time. In between these preloading phases the user writes pixel data to the back frame. If the CPU can handle a maximum of 100,000 writes per second to the GPU (very slow), then the actual data is 800,000 pixels per second, and 640 * 480 is about 300,000 pixels. Therefore it is quite fast for a text display, and can easily hit several frames per second on a slow speed. The card automatically generates frames without any user input, is completely asynchronous from the main board and is optimized for holding a frame long-term.
