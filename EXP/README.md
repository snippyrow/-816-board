# Custom computer expansion cards!

A collection of expansion cards I plan to build for my custom dual-core W65C816S motherboard. Two examples include: a basic text-based graphics card, and some 2MB RAM modules.

## Why Did I Build These?
A computer without a graphical display, or RAM sticks is pretty useless. You can run some basic algorithms, but that's about it. These pieces of customized hardware will *drastically* improve that this build can do. For more information, please see the parent directory for the main build.
