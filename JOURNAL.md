# May 28th: Began laying out PCB!

For the past few weeks I worked on the schematic, going from a quad-core to a dual-core architecture. I had to cut back and expand on several ideas, though it all seems to work according to the datasheets!

# May 29th: Finished laying out PCB

Finished laying out the custom PCB. In the process I removed one of the expansion RAM slots to save on board space, bringing the total amount of expandable memory down to 6MB. Additionally I removed the decoupling capacitors connected to the RAM, as I believe they take up too much space and can be easily added to the individual expansion sticks.
